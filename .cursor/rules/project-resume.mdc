# Project Overview
This project is a Spotify Manager CLI built with oclif and TypeScript. It provides features not available in the official Spotify app, such as liking all songs in a playlist at once, batch operations, and advanced playlist management.

# Architecture
- Built with oclif CLI framework
- Uses spotify-web-api-node for API interactions
- Follows command pattern with nested subcommands (spotify:playlists, spotify:songs)
- OAuth authentication with local callback server
- Environment variables for credentials storage

# Code Standards
1. Use Bun instead of NPM for all operations
2. Write concise, performant code with strong TypeScript typing
3. Follow ES module syntax (import/export)
4. Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
5. Implement proper error handling with descriptive messages
6. Maintain consistent naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes

# Roadmap
- [x] Set up oclif command structure
- [x] Create OAuth with Spotify, save access_token and refresh_token
- [ ] Feature: List all user playlists
- [ ] Feature: Batch operations on songs (like/unlike)
- [ ] Feature: Advanced playlist management
- [ ] Feature: Playlist backup and restoration
