This project will be a spotify managager CLI. It will have features that isn't possible to do on spotify, simple example: like all songs of a playlist.

# Rules
1. Use Bun instead of NPM
2. Make all code concise, performatic and maintainable with high quality typescript safety


# Roadmap

[ ] -> Create Oauth with spotify, save the access_token and refresh_token.
[ ] -> Feature: List all user playlist
