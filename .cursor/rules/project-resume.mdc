# Project Overview
This project is a Spotify Manager CLI built with oclif and TypeScript. It provides features not available in the official Spotify app, such as liking all songs in a playlist at once, batch operations, and advanced playlist management.

# Architecture
- Built with oclif CLI framework
- Uses spotify-web-api-node for API interactions
- Follows command pattern with nested subcommands (spotify:playlists, spotify:songs)
- OAuth authentication with local callback server
- Environment variables for credentials storage

# Code Standards
1. Use Bun instead of NPM for all operations
2. Write concise, performant and focused on maintanability code with strong TypeScript typing
3. Follow ES module syntax (import/export)
5. Never write try catch
6. Maintain consistent naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes
